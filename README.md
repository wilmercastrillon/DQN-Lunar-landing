![CI](https://github.com/emiliomunozai/rl_games/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

A hands-on repo for understanding how Reinforcement Learning works.
Train, inspect, and visualise RL agents on [LunarLander-v3](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/) (or any other Gymnasium environment).

## LunarLander-v3 environment

The default environment is [LunarLander-v3](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/).
The lander starts at the top of the screen and the goal is to land it softly on the landing pad (between the two flags) using thrust and rotation.

### State (observation) — 8 continuous values

| Index | Variable | Description | Range |
|:---:|---|---|---|
| 0 | x | Horizontal position | -2.5 to 2.5 |
| 1 | y | Vertical position | -2.5 to 2.5 |
| 2 | vx | Horizontal velocity | -10 to 10 |
| 3 | vy | Vertical velocity | -10 to 10 |
| 4 | angle | Angle of the lander (radians) | -6.28 to 6.28 |
| 5 | angular velocity | Rotation speed | -10 to 10 |
| 6 | left leg contact | 1 if left leg touches ground, 0 otherwise | 0 or 1 |
| 7 | right leg contact | 1 if right leg touches ground, 0 otherwise | 0 or 1 |

### Actions — 4 discrete

| Value | Action |
|:---:|---|
| 0 | Do nothing |
| 1 | Fire left orientation engine (rotate right) |
| 2 | Fire main engine (thrust up) |
| 3 | Fire right orientation engine (rotate left) |

### Rewards

| Event | Reward |
|---|---|
| Moving towards the landing pad | positive, proportional to distance reduction |
| Moving away from the landing pad | negative |
| Crash | **-100** |
| Successful landing (come to rest) | **+100** |
| Each leg ground contact | **+10** |
| Firing main engine (per frame) | **-0.3** |
| Firing side engine (per frame) | **-0.03** |

An episode is considered **solved** at **+200** points average over 100 episodes.
The episode ends when the lander crashes, lands, or after **1000 time steps** (truncation).

> Run `rlgames inspect` to see live state/action/reward values from the environment.

## Quick concepts — Q-Learning methods

### The core idea

An RL agent interacts with an **environment** in discrete time steps.
At each step it observes a **state** $s$, picks an **action** $a$, receives a **reward** $r$, and transitions to a new state $s'$.
The goal is to learn a **policy** $\pi(s) \to a$ that maximises the total (discounted) reward over time.

### Q-values and the Bellman equation

A **Q-value** $Q(s, a)$ estimates the expected cumulative reward of taking action $a$ in state $s$ and then following the optimal policy.
The optimal Q-values satisfy the **Bellman optimality equation**:

$$
Q^*(s, a) = r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s', a')
$$

where $\gamma \in [0, 1]$ is the **discount factor** (how much the agent cares about future vs. immediate rewards).

### Tabular Q-Learning

When the state and action spaces are small (or can be discretized), we store Q-values in a table and update them after every transition:

$$
Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \bigl[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \bigr]
$$

- $\alpha$ (learning rate) — how fast we update.
- **$\varepsilon$-greedy** exploration — with probability $\varepsilon$ pick a random action, otherwise pick $\arg\max_a Q(s, a)$. $\varepsilon$ decays over time so the agent gradually shifts from exploring to exploiting.

> See `src/rl_games/agents/qlearning.py` for a complete tabular implementation.

### Deep Q-Network (DQN)

When the state space is continuous (like the 8-dimensional LunarLander observation), a table no longer works.
**DQN** replaces the table with a neural network $Q_\theta(s, a)$ and introduces two key tricks:

| Trick | Why |
|---|---|
| **Experience replay** | Store transitions in a buffer, sample random mini-batches — breaks correlation between consecutive samples and reuses data. |
| **Target network** | Keep a frozen copy of the Q-network and update it periodically — stabilises the moving Bellman target. |

Training step (one gradient update):

1. Sample a mini-batch $\{(s, a, r, s', \text{done})\}$ from the replay buffer.
2. Compute targets: $y = r + \gamma \cdot \max_{a'} Q_{\text{target}}(s', a') \cdot (1 - \text{done})$.
3. Minimise MSE between $Q_\theta(s, a)$ and $y$.

> See `src/rl_games/agents/dqn.py` for a from-scratch PyTorch implementation where every component (network, replay buffer, training loop) is visible and editable.

### Exploration vs. Exploitation

This is the fundamental trade-off in RL.
**Explore** (random actions) to discover new, potentially better strategies.
**Exploit** (greedy actions) to collect the highest reward based on current knowledge.
The $\varepsilon$-greedy schedule balances both: start with high $\varepsilon$ (mostly exploring) and anneal towards low $\varepsilon$ (mostly exploiting).

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

## CLI usage

```bash
rlgames <command> [agent] [options]
```

### Version

```bash
rlgames version
```

### List agents and their save status

```bash
rlgames list
```

### Inspect an environment

Show state/action spaces and sample a few random transitions to see what the agent observes.

```bash
rlgames inspect                          # LunarLander-v3 (default)
rlgames inspect --steps 10              # more sample transitions
```

### Initialize a new untrained agent

```bash
rlgames init qlearning
rlgames init dqn
```

### Train an agent

Creates a save if none exists, resumes from an existing save otherwise.

```bash
rlgames train qlearning --episodes 20000
rlgames train dqn       --episodes 500
```

### Load a save and display info

```bash
rlgames load qlearning
rlgames load dqn --eval
```

### Simulate episodes (text output)

Run a trained agent and see every action, reward, and outcome in the terminal.

```bash
rlgames sim qlearning --episodes 3              # full episodes
rlgames sim dqn       --episodes 2 --verbose    # full episodes with state vectors
rlgames sim dqn       --episodes 5 --steps 10   # only first 10 steps per episode
```

### Render episodes (graphical window)

```bash
rlgames render qlearning --episodes 3
rlgames render dqn       --episodes 3
```

### Delete a saved agent

```bash
rlgames delete qlearning
rlgames delete dqn
```
